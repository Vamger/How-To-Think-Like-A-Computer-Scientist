# Write a function slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)
# that returns the slope of the line through
# the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
# Be sure your implementation of slope can
# pass the following tests:

'''

test(slope(5, 3, 4, 2) == 1.0)
test(slope(1, 2, 3, 2) == 0.0)
test(slope(1, 2, 3, 3) == 0.5)
test(slope(2, 4, 1, 2) == 2.0)
