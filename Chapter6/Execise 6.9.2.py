# Write a function day_name that converts an integer number o to 6
# into the name of the day. Assume day 0 is "Sunday". Once again,
# return None if the arguments to the function are not valid.
# Here are some tests that should pass:

test(day_name(3) == "Wednesday")
test(day_name(6) == "Saturday")
test(day_name(42) == None )
